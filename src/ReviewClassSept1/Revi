Type Casting
	Type casting is converting the type of data from one data type to another one. We have 2 types of types casting.
	1) Explicit/narrowing/Manual 
	2) Implicit/Widening/Automatic
	When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one it is called Explicit/narrowing/Manual 
	and when we go from a smaller data type to a larger data type we call it Implicit/Widening/Automatic
	1)byte(8); 2)short(16); char(16); 3)int(32); 
	4)long(64); 5)float(32); 6)double(64)
	byte->short;char->int->long->float->double
	Why we need type casting?
	When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different data types.
	When we are working with math some time we need to get rid off decimal parts as we are only 
	interested in the non- decimal part as we are only interested in the non- decimal part.
	
	What is the syntax?
Explicit/narrowing/Manual
    int box=1000;
     byte box2=(byte) box;
Implicit/widening/Automatic

short box1=250;
int box2=box1;

=================================================
If statements:
	if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision 
	based on some condition and provided data.
	if condition
	if else condition
	if else if condition
	nested if else condition
	
Why we should learn about if else condition?
	when we are solving real life problems like testing a web site our program 
	needs to make a lot of decisions.
