 * what is type casting?
 * type casting is converting one data type to another data type
 * WHy should I learn about type  casting?
 * so that we can use the code that is written by someone else to make our life easier
 * or when we will be working in teams we will be able to merge the code
 * What is the syntax for the type casting?
 * when we are converting something smaller to larger we don't need to do anything 
 * it happens automatically we just assign the variable for example 
 * 
 * int box=1234:
 * 
 * long box2=box; //this is how it works and and it is called implicit or widening automatic
 * 
 * however when we convert a larger data type to a small data type 
 * then this is how we do it
 * 
 * long box=1245454;
 *  
 *  int box2=(int) box; narrowing or explicit or manual conversion
 *
