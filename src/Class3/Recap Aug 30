Class 2-Manual Testing
Recap
Why do we need to test? 
-to assure the quality of the software, we need to test it

STLC
*Requirement analysis: against SMART criteria
	Specific
	Measurable
	Attainable (doable)
	Relevant
	Time based
	
	*Test planning - test plan - Test/QA Lead/ Manager
	
	*Test case development 
	
	
	
	TESTING HIERARCHY

	UAT-User acceptance testing -> staging/cert/qual/MR3 -where clients testers perform testing/uat testing
	Production - it is live environment

	What we should do when we found a bug?
	
* Verify if it is reproducible or not
Read the requirements to make sure that the bug you found is actually a bug

* Intermittent bugs (sometimes they appear, sometimes they don't)

Bug Life Cycle
-New->posted for first time
-Rejected-> wrong info, cleared by devs, happened not a first time
-Assigned->lead of the team assigns the bug to devs

cycle of bug:
   		open->fixed->retest->reopened->closed


How to report it?

Collect as much as information possible:
- Exact steps we took to reproduce the bug
- Browser, time, the environment, test data, logs, screenshots or screen recording

Severity -  the seriousness of the  (Low; Medium; High)
Priority - Show stopper; Major; Minor; Cosmetic

2 Types of Testing:
-Functional to check the functionality of the application
-Non-functional- backend testing behind the scenes

Regression testing - testing the complete functionality // previously executed tests are passed after making changes to a system -> done by QA
Unit - only one part testing -> testing by devs,
Integration - complete application with newly added features or modified code works properly with existing features and modules-> testing  by QA
System testing - testing complete and fully Integrated software product (UI, API, Data Base, server)->QA performs these testings
Smoke testing - quickly scans the application through multiple high level scenarios under 30 minutes to make sure the the application is working fine 
Functional + Non-functional testing= System testing -> done by QA
