Loops
it is a general concept in any programming language which allow to run 
certain piece/block of code multiple times



Limitations:
 		data type: CANNOT work with double, float, long, boolean

 		operators: CANNOT work with logical and relational

Types of loops:
1. While loop
2. Do while loop
3. For loop
4. Enhanced loop

System.out.println("Good morning");
System.out.println("Good morning");
System.out.println("Good morning");
System.out.println("Good morning");
System.out.println("Good morning");

	int time=11;
	if (time<12){
		System.out.println("Good morning");
		}
		
		while (time<12){
		System.out.println("Good morning");}
	
	
		
While Loop first checks the condition if condition 
is true then control goes inside the loop body 
otherwise goes outside of the body. 

while loop syntax

while(boolean condition) {
	
	code to be repeated;

}



DO WHILE LOOP syntax
do while loop is similar to while loop with only 
difference that it checks for condition after 
executing the statements
	int i=0;
	do { 
	code to be repeated; (syso);i++;
	}while (boolean condition);
	
	while vs do while --> both loops executed while condition is true
	
	while loop first check condition -> if true_.executes code do while
	first EXECITES code -> then checks condition
	
	FOR LOOP syntax
	The Java for loop is used to iterate a part of the 
	program several times. If the number of iteration is 
	fixed, it is recommended to use for loop.
	
	for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
	code to be repeated;}
	
	// Hello 5 times; 
	for (int i=1; i<=5; i++){
	syso("Hello");}
	
	When to use which loop:
	
	When we know in advance how many times to repeat block of
	code-> USE FOR LOOP
	
	When we know in advance how many times to repeat block of code -> USE FOR LOOP

	when we do  not know in advance how many times to repeat block of code -> USE WHILE OR DO WHILE
	
	
	
	Loops in Java
	Class 8
	
while
do while
for 
enhanced for loop/for each loop/advanced for loop

for loop - when we know number of 
repetitions/iterations in advance

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
code repeat;
}
while loop and do while -> if we don't know number of repetitions

while vs do while

while checks condition first -> then executes code
do while executes code->then check condition

while	(boolean condition){
code repeat;
}

do{
code repeat;
}while (boolean condition);




BREAK - breaks the loop and it usually used inside some type of conditions


CONTINUE - continues to the next iteration/cycle 
moment java sees continue->it goes back to the beginning of the loop
it usually used in some type of conditions

Nested Loops
Loop inside another loop

for (int i=1; i<3; i++){  -->outer loop
syso("Hello"):// will executed 2 times
	for (int j=1; j<=3; j++){ -->nested loop
	syso("Bye");}
}
